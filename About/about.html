                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello! I’m Ben Purchase, a Computer Science student with a deep passion for problem-solving, technology, and language learning.  
                   I've thrive in dynamic environments, love taking on new challenges, and am constantly seeking new opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>I believe my academic and professional journey has been shaped greatly thanks to my experience living in multiple countries, attending boarding school, and working in customer-facing roles.  
                   These experiences have developed my adaptability, leadership skills, and ability to connect with people from different backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Currently, I’m studying Computer Science at the University of Lincoln and spending a semester abroad in Madrid.  
                   Alongside my studies, I’m actively seeking a year-in-industry placement to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry.</p>

            <div class="about-text">
                <h2>Upbringing</h2>
                <p>Growing up in a military family meant constant movement, adapting to new environments, and meeting people from all walks of life.  
                   This has included spending 3 years in Cyprus, 2 years in Germany, and living in the Netherlands since 2021.</p>
                <p>One of the most defining aspects of my upbringing was attending boarding school at two key stages of my life (ages 11-13 and 16-18).  
                   I feel as though this experience taught me independence, resilience, and how to form meaningful connections quickly.  
                   Being away from home at a young age helped me develop strong interpersonal skills—a crucial ability when working within teams or leading projects.</p>
                <p>Living in different countries also introduced me to diverse cultures and languages, which sparked my love for language learning.  
                   I have these experiences to thank for continuing to shape my approach to both life and work to be  as open-minded and adaptable as possible.</p>

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>One of my biggest passions is problem-solving, which is why I love Computer Science.  
                   Whether it’s writing efficient code, debugging complex issues, or optimizing algorithms,  
                   I've allways found that I really enjoy the challenge of breaking down problems and finding elegant solutions.</p>
                <p>Beyond coding, my interest in languages means that I am currently learning Spanish and Dutch (at an intermediate level),  
                   as well as having previously studied German and Russian.  
                   I'm of the opinion that learning languages not only enhances my communication skills but also helps me understand different cultures on a deeper level.</p>
                <p>When I’m not working on tech projects or language learning, I love to explore new places, connect with people from different backgrounds, and stay engaged in continuous learning.</p>

                <h2>Current Life & Future Plans</h2>
                <p>Right now, I’m spending a semester in Madrid, studying Computer Science at Universidad Carlos III.  
                   This opportunity allows me to gain international academic experience and expand my cultural understanding.</p>
                <p>Alongside my studies, I am actively searching for a year-in-industry placement in the tech field.  
                   I am particularly interested in software development, data science, and AI, allthough my passions within computer science also expand beyond these.
                   I’m very eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting.</p>
                <p>In the near future, I aim to work in an international tech environment, combining my love for technology, problem-solving, and cross-cultural collaboration.</p>
