                <p>
                    At The University of Lincoln my group was taked with a hard task of creating three working parts to a robot waiter of which my part was allocated within our group to work 
                    on the Speech Interpereter section. This involved planning out how we would tackle this project and starting early, to test the viability of various ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin with, the plan was to utilize the recently released local version of <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/" target="_blank">Deepseek AI</a> within a web GUI for ease of acess,
                    however after a painstaking process of trying to get the smaller, easier to run models working properly (without halucinating/trailing off) we realized we would have to cut 
                    our losses as the AI just wasn't ready given the combination of models available, hardware available for us to use, and time left. We also didn't want to utilize non-local
                    models as we didn't want to spend any money. This early version of the project is still <a href="https://github.com/BenPurch/Deepseek-test-for-Robot-Waiter-Speech-Interpereter" target="_blank">on my github</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the setbacks involved with trying to get the AI version of the speech interpereter working we realised that we needed to take a step back and re-evaluate how to tackle
                    the problem. We started back from scratch with a command line version of the interpereter that simply understood when specific items were mentioned. From here we could work 
                    slowly and begin adding other features we needed, such as the ability to save orders, a way for the waiter to give the robot other menu items, and understanding of multiples
                    of items on the menu (e.g. two pizzas, five chicken). This allowed us time to add further quality of life features such as a GUI using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" target="_blank">Tkinter</a>,
                    a way for the waiter to set the number of tables and a page for the customer to select their table, a visual way for the user to edit their order, and a printed reciept for 
                    the waiter to see the orders as well as the table number and the time of order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allough we wanted to, we didn't have enought time left, nor time with the robot itself to fully implement the seperate modules together (allthough this wasn't an issue for the 
                    project as integration was never required within the project), however we did theorise some ways, which made its way into the report.
