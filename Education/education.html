                <p>My time at Stamford School played a key role in shaping both my academic and personal development.  
                    Having attended as a boarding student during two key periods of my life, I learned early on how to be independent, self-disciplined, and adaptable—qualities that have served me well in both university and work.</p>
             
                 <p>During my GCSE years, I developed a strong interest in maths and physics, enjoying the logical problem-solving and analytical thinking required in both subjects.  
                    This passion led me to choose Maths, Economics, and Physics at A-Levels, where I then honed my ability to break down complex problems and approach them methodically.  
                    Economics, in particular, gave me insight into data-driven decision-making, a skill that would later complement my technical abilities in Computer Science.</p>
             
                 <p>Although my academic journey had challenges, I believe that my strong work ethic and ability to perform under pressure were shown during my mock A-Level exams, where I achieved A, A, and B grades  
                     resulting in me receiving an unconditional offer from the University of Lincoln—an opportunity I seized with the determination to go as far as I can in life.</p>

            <div class="education-text">
                <p>Growing up, I was always fascinated by computers. At the age of 10, I got my first Raspberry Pi, which sparked my passion for programming.  
                    I started by learning HTML and CSS thanks to the help of my year-6 teacher running a club for me and my friends, where we would build simple web pages and experiment with different designs.  
                    As I grew older, my interest evolved into modding my favourite games, including Minecraft and GMod, particularly during the 2020 lockdown.  
                    This self-driven learning gave me early exposure to scripting, debugging, and working within an established framework—valuable skills that carried over into my university studies.</p>

                <p>During my first year at university, I was introduced to Python and C#, learning best practices for effective memory utilization and software optimization.  
                    These foundational skills allowed me to begin working on personal coding projects, applying what I had learned in a hands-on manner.  
                    In my second year, I expanded my knowledge into network fundamentals and SQL, further preparing myself for industry-level work involving data management and secure communication protocols.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am working on an exciting group project with the university, utilizing the TIAGo robot to develop a fully functional robot waiter.  
                    This project involves LIDAR for object detection, color cameras for gesture recognition, and integrating an LLM (Large Language Model) for customer interaction.  
                    All of the challenges of merging multiple technologies into a single cohesive system is only further strengthening my skills in AI, robotics, and collaborative development.</p>

                <p>My consistent First-Class grades and exemplary attendance led to an incredible opportunity for me to study abroad at Universidad Carlos III in Madrid.  
                    This experience is not only expanding my technical knowledge but also allowing me to engage with a diverse international academic environment.</p>
             
                 <p>Looking ahead, I am currently seeking a Year-in-Industry placement before my final year of university.  
                    This will provide me with practical, hands-on experience in the field, ensuring that I graduate with the necessary industry-ready skills to make an immediate impact.</p>
